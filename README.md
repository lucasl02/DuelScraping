# DuelScraping
WIP in web scraping FD to automate a wager tracking system. 

## Usage
- Uses requests library as first attempt
- Uses Selenium with anti-detection measures
- Extracts NBA betting data from FanDuel
- Set unique user data directory to avoid conflicts
- Multiple CSS selectors for reliable scraping

## Troubleshooting
- Permission errors: Use chmod +x
- Connection errors: Check IP isn't blocked
- Element not found: Try different selectors
